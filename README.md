# Minecraft-Legends-docs
A documetation of the Minecraft Legends files
I have created this Wiki to document the Minecraft Legends files and what they do. Why you might ask? Because why not. I'm just interested in the way games function and how to edit the files to see what's possible. I'm new to all of this (like ALL of this) but i wanna learn some new things.
